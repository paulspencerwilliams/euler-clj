# euler-clj

To improve my Clojure skills, constant exposure to the language and toolchain
is required. I intend to complete a Project Euler, and 4Clojure challenge each 
day. This is the repo for the Project Euler thread of this activity.
 
Although I general test using the excellent Midje library, I'm using default 
clojure.test so I can play with Cursive Clojure's test support.   

## Usage
